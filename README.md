# Reversi-Game
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reversi
NOTE: This was a collaborative project with two other team members. 

This provides a server that can host any n clients in playing a multiplayer Reversi game, a client that can communicate with the server, and an automated client, that can automatically play the game (albeit, it simply makes random requests until a valid one comes in).
The game board can be of any n size.
